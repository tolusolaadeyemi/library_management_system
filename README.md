# library_management_system
This is an LMS I built to help with my continued understanding of Django. Users can login as either an admin(librarian) or client. Currently the Admin can perform all CRUD functions regarding the Library Books and the Registered Users. Admin can also send out automatic emails when Book Requests of Clients are approved/denied. Users can create accounts, login and request/return library books. There is going to be a payment feature for Overdue books and I plan to implement this using the Paystack API.


Login info (admin)
email: lib@yahoo.com
password:libspeaker

Feel free to create your own user account! Also you may need to import the books csv (part of my repo) into your DB to access the data.
